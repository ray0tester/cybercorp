CREATE A FILE THEN SAVE IT
FOR EXAMPLE I WILL CREATE A FILE NAMED malware.php
THEN INSIDE THE malware.php WRITE any virus patterns to detect

//for example malware.php code


<?php

    $encoded = "ZXZhbChcJF9QT1NUWydjbWQnXSk7"; 
    $decoded = base64_decode($encoded);

    echo "Decoded : " . $decoded;

?>



//example for txt file save this as malware.txt
JUST WRITRE virus THEN SAVE
